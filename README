Mordor

Mordor  is a procedurally generated 3D scene of a volcano. The application is designed and constructed utilising DirectX10 to demonstrate procedural generation, post-processing and an interactive camera.

 The Mordor application consists of a number of elements:

ñ	A section of terrain that forms into a volcano with a crater and lava flows over time: This terrain is created using a combination of procedural techniques to generate a height-map and to texture it. The user can reset the scene to generate a new volcano or choose to auto-complete the generation.

ñ	An animated post-processing effect to simulate a heat haze: This effect is applied to the scene after the terrain is completely generated and the user can choose to toggle this effect on and off. 

ñ	Particle effect systems to represent smoke plumes, spitting fire and falling ash: Particles are generated procedurally using the geometry shader.

ñ	Textures generated using simplex noise on the GPU: The terrain is fully procedurally textured and the scene also includes a simple sky sphere with animated cloud texture. 

ñ	Two different cameras: The user is able to switch between an automated camera circling the terrain and a free-moving camera which they can control using the keyboard and mouse.
